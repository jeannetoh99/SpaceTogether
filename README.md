# SpaceTogether

Built specifically for Social Distancing Ambassadors and Introverts alike. SpaceTogether will scare away all that are within 6 feet of your personal space, *literally*.



## What it does 

Plays a noise when someone is near, simple. Noise is not scary enough? Record your own voice. *(protip: **scream** or tell them to **go away**)*



## How we built it

SpaceTogether was built using Swift Framework around the ```CoreBluetooth``` library provided by Apple. 

Using ```CoreBluetooth``` , SpaceTogether is able to send and receive requests from participating devices to detect whether another device is within the phones Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) range. 



## What's next for SpaceTogether

SpaceTogether team would like to continue working to fix known issues like using the App in the background. 

Potential features could include:

* Airdropping a *friendly* note to someone nearby to back off
* Dashboard for seeing how many people have tried to invade your personal space



## Team

SpaceTogether was brought to you by 4 bored college kids: 

Dev - @kerwin97 @jeannetoh99 @elsakoh

Design - Andrea Low
